Problem: 
How many times have you had trouble trying to find information about a song, upcoming concerts for that artist, and getting some movie info while you wait in line for the concert to start. 

OF COURSE DOZENS OF TIMES! That's why I made Liri Bot to help with such a predicament.

Code Overview:
First off we have to install all of the NPM packages into our repo and create our JSON file 
Next up we have to assign user input to variables that we can call 
Then we call the movie function if a user asks for movie details and print those back in the console for viewing 
Then we call the spotify API if the user asks for song info and prints that back in the console for viewing 
Then we call the movies API if the user asks for movie details and prints that back in the console for viewing 
Lastly we call the function to append all called information to the text file for an audit trail 

Instructions to Run: 
To run the Liri bot, you first need to install the repo on your machine and run npm install to download all packages
Once those are done, you need to run "node liri" + your operator + your selector (which can be multi-word)
Once you choose a operator and selector you can run it and get a response with your relevant data printed to the text file

I used NPM, JSON, AXIOS, FS, Moment, Colors, Request, For loops, functions, queryURL's, and nested IF statements in my code

I, Ryan Sims, had the sole role in designing, coding, and publishing such a seamless, disruptive product.
